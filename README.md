# Reflection-and-refraction-of-EMW
 This application is designed to teach students of radio engineering the laws of Fresnel and Snell. The program shows how the amplitude of the waves changes depending on the angle of incidence on the interface between two dielectrics. It was one of the first projects in python and programming in general, so the quality of the code is rather mediocre.
